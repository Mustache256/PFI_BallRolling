# PFI_BallRolling

This is a project I created for my Programming for Interaction Univversity assignemnt in Second Year.
The project itself is a monkey ball clone that features 4 levels with an extra tutorial level.
The unity version used to create this poject is 2019.4.30f, so when attempting to open the project, please consider using this version of unity as to
avoid any issues with upgrading or downgrading the project to different versions.
